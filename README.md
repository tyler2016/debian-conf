# debian-conf

There are a lot configuration files which I am using about debian plus other different linux distros.

- `.vimrc` 
    + $HOME or /root
    + vim runtime configuration which affacts vim editor.

- `.bashrc` 
    + $HOME
    + it will be executed when an interactive shell(e.g. bash) is invoked.
    + related_link: http://hacktux.com/bash/bashrc/bash_profile

- `.gdc.sh` 
    + $HOME
    + my[Dax G.] own shell scripts, included in .bashrc with a dot command[.]
    + it contains:
        * alias
        * export
        * and so on
- `sources.lit` 
    + /etc/apt/
    + it is used with `apt-` commands.
